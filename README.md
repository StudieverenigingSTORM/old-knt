# old-knt

This is a project designed to "archive" the current (hopefully old soon) knt system.

The jar file itself is not safe to destribute since it contains sensitive credentials baked in. So what this will be is:
- A repository containing an updated version of the source code made to work with modern versions of java and the credentials ripped out.
- An "upgraded" version of the knt with a few security fixes, tweaks and old unused features ripped out.
