# old-knt

This is a project designed to "archive" the current (hopefully old soon) knt system and provide improvements to the entire system.

What this will be is:
- The original jar file (checked for sensitive credetials)
- A repository containing an updated version of the source code made to work with modern versions of java and the credentials ripped out.
- An "upgraded" version of the knt with a few security fixes, tweaks and old unused features ripped out.
